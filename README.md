# 2E10-Buggy-Project
- This is the code we used for our autonomous buggy project for the module 2E10.
  Bronze Challenge:
  In this challenge our task was to have the buggy follow the white line around a track using its IR sensors, stop for any objects on the track using US sensor, as well as this it needed     to report telemetry data to the GUI.
  Silver Challenge:
  In this challenge our task was to implement two PID controllers, one to follow objects at a set distance and one to controlt the exact speed of the buggy. The distance for following as     well as the the speed was controlled by the GUI and sent via a local network to the arduino.
  Gold Challenge:
  In this challenge a we were tasked with implementing computer vision for the buggy to read signs and act according to the instrucitons on the signs. This was done by the use of a Husky     AI lense that could read and learn QR codes.
